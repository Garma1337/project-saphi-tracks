# Extensions

If you want to contribute and are looking for some inspirations, maybe take a look at
some of the ideas listed below.

## REST API

* Custom repositories for each model type so we can define custom logic for each model
* Support for custom tracks in a beta phase (while in beta, tracks can still be updated)
* Support for transactional database operations via repositories (currently each operation is separate)
* Filtering custom tracks and users by more complex fields, such as date created, date updated, etc.

## Frontend

* MVVM architecture (currently a lot of logic sits inside the views)
* Settings editor for administrators
* Support for additional languages (especially spanish and german)
